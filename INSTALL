============
Installation
============

The installation procedure uses CMake, as follows:

Unpack the tar archive and change into the unpacked directory.

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..  # CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local
  make install

You can set options for compiling using the CMake GUI by replacing the cmake
command with

  cmake-gui ..

or by setting the options manually, e.g.

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local ..

in order to set the install prefix to ~/local

=======================
Intel compiler settings
=======================

The Intel compiler can improve performance by vectorizing certain
parts of the code on x86 architectures. Assuming your CPU supports
AVX2, the following options will increase encoding speed.

  ./configure CC=icc
  make CFLAGS="-O3 -xCORE-AVX2" bench

On a 3.4 GHz E3-1240 v3 we see more than 400 MiB/s for encoding
typical data.

Using other SIMD instruction sets on older CPUs may also help.
